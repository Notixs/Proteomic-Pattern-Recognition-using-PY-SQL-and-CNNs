# Proteomic-Pattern-Recognition-using-PY-SQL-and-CNNs
This project establishes a complete bioinformatics and machine learning pipeline within a Google Colab environment, designed to simulate and analyze proteomic sequence data from a planarian model.
# The Idea
The workflow begins by generating a controlled, simulated dataset of protein sequences where a specific motif (the "pattern") is programmatically injected into half of the sequences, creating the necessary ground truth for supervised learning. This organized data is then immediately ingested into a custom SQLite database, which serves as a structured, portable, and queryable data source, facilitating clean data management and routing within the Colab file system.

The core of the project involves routing this proteomic data from the SQLite database to a machine learning script. The raw sequences are transformed using One-Hot Encoding to convert amino acid strings into numerical matrices—a format essential for neural networks. This pre-processed data is used to train a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a powerful architecture for sequence analysis. The CNN's convolutional filters are tasked with autonomously learning and recognizing the local amino acid patterns (motifs) that differentiate the sequences with the injected pattern from the rest. This system provides a robust, end-to-end framework for rapid prototyping and validation of machine learning methods for complex biological pattern recognition tasks.
